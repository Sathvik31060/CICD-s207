CI/CD Cloud DevOps:

DevOps is the combination of developer and operations team.

Dev- Tools: build, code, test, plan.

Ops- Release, manage, monitor, deploy.

Why DevOps?
For continuous integration And continuous Delivery/deployment.

Continuous Integration:- 
--> Automatically build and test when there is a change in code.
--> Ensure bug free code.
--> Ensures higher code quality and reduces integration issues.
--> Packing the application (war/jar/docker image).

Continuous Deployment:-
--> Automatically deploy application for production.

Life Cycle:
Code--->Build--->Test--->Deploy

For coding we use Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
For Building it will generate either jar/war/docker image.
For Testing we use SonarQube, Junit, Pytest.
For Deploying we use Apache/Tomcat.
